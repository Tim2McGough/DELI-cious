This application is a sandwich shops ordering tool intended to be used by employees.

The program runs using 9 classes:
1.Main
2.UserInterface
3.Order
4.MenuItem
5.ToppingManger
6.Chips
7.Receipt Generator
8.Drink
9.Sandwich

Main
--
This is just the main screen that runs the other classes

User Interface
--
This handles everything that user sees

Order
--
This describes what a Order is so it can store and use that info for later

MenuItem
--
defines a menu item as a thing that has a cost

Topping manager
--
Handles all things topping

Chips
--
simply defines what a chip is

ReceiptGenerator
--
Prints out a simple receipt to a folder of receipts. Ideally I wanted to print out the entire order but unfortunately it got pushed to a "to do" that I never got around to.

Drink
--
Defines a drink
